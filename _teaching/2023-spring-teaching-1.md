I co-developed and taught the Computational Neurology workshop for Bachelor and Master's Student from the Medical, Informatics, Engineer and Neuroscience Departments of the Ruhr University Bochum/TU Dortmund. This was a highly interdisciplinary workshop including students with a very diverse background and consisting in lectures based on direct formal teaching and exercises based on Jupyter Notebooks, together with a final group project. Aim of the workshop was to provide students with a comprehensive overview of methods in neuroimaging preprocessing and to teach them how to develop biologically realistic models of whole-brain functional activity. The notebooks are available [here](https://github.com/computational-neurology/workshop2024/).
